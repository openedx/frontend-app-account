/**
 * This polyfill is from MDN:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia
 *
 * Their description:
 * "Here's an example of using navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(), with a
 * polyfill to cope with older browsers. Note that this polyfill does not
 * correct for legacy differences in constraints syntax, which means constraints
 * won't work well across browsers. It is recommended to use the adapter.js
 * polyfill instead, which does handle constraints."
 *
 * Despite the lack of support for differences in constraints we'll use this
 * since it's small and simple and we don't have a need for constraints at the
 * moment. I've added an export hasGetUserMediaSupport before the polyfill to
 * help us understand support before making calls to getUserMedia.
