Getting Started
***************

Prerequisites
=============

`Tutor`_ is currently recommended as a development environment for your
new MFE. Please refer
to the `relevant tutor-mfe documentation`_ to get started using it.

.. _Tutor: https://github.com/overhangio/tutor

.. _relevant tutor-mfe documentation: https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-mfe?tab=readme-ov-file#mfe-development

Plugins
=======
This MFE can be customized using `Frontend Plugin Framework <https://github.com/openedx/frontend-plugin-framework>`_.

The parts of this MFE that can be customized in that manner are documented `here </src/plugin-slots>`_.

Environment Variables/Setup Notes
=================================

This MFE is configured via the ``frontend-platform`` configuration module. For more information on MFE configuration see the `Configuration documentation`_.

The account settings micro-frontend also supports the following additional variable:

``SUPPORT_URL``

Example: ``https://support.example.com``

The fully-qualified URL to the support page in the target environment.

``PASSWORD_RESET_SUPPORT_LINK``

Examples:

- ``https://support.edx.org/hc/en-us/articles/206212088-What-if-I-did-not-receive-a-password-reset-message-``

- ``mailto:support@example.com``

The fully-qualified URL to the support page or email to request the support from in the target environment.

``ENABLE_ACCOUNT_DELETION``

Example: ``'false'`` | ``''`` (empty strings are true)

Enable the account deletion option, defaults to true.
To disable account deletion set ``ENABLE_ACCOUNT_DELETION`` to ``'false'`` (string), otherwise it will default to true.

Example build syntax with a single environment variable:

.. code:: bash

   NODE_ENV=development ACCESS_TOKEN_COOKIE_NAME='edx-jwt-cookie-header-payload' npm run build

For more information see the document: `Configuration documentation`_

.. _Configuration documentation: https://openedx.github.io/frontend-platform/module-Config.html

Cloning and Startup
===================

.. code-block::


  1. Clone your new repo:

    ``git clone https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-account.git``

  2. Use node v18.x.

    The current version of the micro-frontend build scripts support node 18.
    Using other major versions of node *may* work, but this is unsupported.  For
    convenience, this repository includes an .nvmrc file to help in setting the
    correct node version via `nvm <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>`_.

  3. Install npm dependencies:

    ``cd frontend-app-account && npm ci``

  4. Start the dev server:

    ``npm start``

Local module development
=========================

To develop locally on modules that are installed into this app, you'll need to create a ``module.config.js``
file (which is git-ignored) that defines where to find your local modules, for instance:

.. code-block:: js

   module.exports = {
     /*
     Modules you want to use from local source code.  Adding a module here means that when this app
     runs its build, it'll resolve the source from peer directories of this app.

     moduleName: the name you use to import code from the module.
     dir: The relative path to the module's source code.
     dist: The sub-directory of the source code where it puts its build artifact.  Often "dist", though you
       may want to use "src" if the module installs React as a peer/dev dependency.
     */
     localModules: [
        { moduleName: '@openedx/paragon/scss', dir: '../paragon', dist: 'scss' },
        { moduleName: '@openedx/paragon', dir: '../paragon', dist: 'dist' },
        { moduleName: '@openedx/frontend-enterprise', dir: '../frontend-enterprise', dist: 'src' },
        { moduleName: '@openedx/frontend-platform', dir: '../frontend-platform', dist: 'dist' },
     ],
   };

See https://github.com/openedx/frontend-build#local-module-configuration-for-webpack for more details.

Known Issues
===========

None

Development Roadmap
===================

We don't have anything planned for the core of the MFE (the account settings page) - this MFE is currently in maintenance mode.
There may be a replacement for IDV coming down the pipe, so that may be DEPRed.
